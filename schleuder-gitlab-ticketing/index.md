title: Schleuder-gitlab-ticketing

Schleuder Gitlab Ticketing combines a schleuder list with the issue tracker of a gitlab project and operates as a state tracker of threads on the list. This allows one to keep an overview on the state of various requests on a help desk powered by schleuder

It is hooked into schleuder by a) installing the gem and b) configuring schleuder lists to use that plugin.

For details and instructions on how to install and use it, please read the [Readme](https://0xacab.org/schleuder/schleuder-gitlab-ticketing/blob/master/README.md).
