Since Schleuder 3.3.0 it is possible to extend the schleuder filters through externally provided filters. A project that is using this mechanism is the [schleuder-gitlab-ticketing](schleuder-gitlab-ticketing) project, that provides tracking functionality of your schleuder messaging within a gitlab issue tracker. This is especially built and helpful for schleuder lists being used as helpdesk or project gateway. Read more about the functionality on the projects summary page: [schleuder-gitlab-ticketing](schleuder-gitlab-ticketing).
