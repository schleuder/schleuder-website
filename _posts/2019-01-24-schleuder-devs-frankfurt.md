For everyone located in or near Frankfurt/Main, Germany (or willing to travel): On Friday, Feb 1st, the Schleuder development team will meet in a restaurant in Frankfurt, and would be pleased to have a chat with you! We have no schedule, just time to sit around, discuss ideas, ask questions, and have some drinks or food. Anyone is welcome, be they technically minded, politically interested or simply curious! *Friday, 2019-02-01, from 7pm (local time), at Heck Meck* (Friesengasse 19, Frankfurt am Main, Germany).
