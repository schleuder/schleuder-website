For everyone located in or near Berlin, Germany (or willing to travel): On Friday, March 20th, the Schleuder development team will meet in a restaurant in Berlin, and would be pleased to have a chat with you! 

We have no schedule, just time to sit around, discuss ideas, ask questions, and have some drinks or food. Anyone is welcome, be they technically minded, politically interested or simply curious! *Friday, 2020-03-20, from 7pm (local time), at Jolesch* (Muskauer Str. 1, 10997 Berlin, Germany).
