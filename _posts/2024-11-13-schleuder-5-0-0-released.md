title:  "Schleuder 5.0.0 released"
date: "2024-11-13"

This release brings some improvements and bug fixes, but breaks usage only by changing technical dependencies and dropping the default setting of one config option:

* Schleuder by default doesn't lookup keys on a traditional HKP keyserver anymore. The HKP keyserver network is basically dead and should be avoided. You can still set the config option to a keyserver of your choice and Schleuder will use it. We encourage to do so only for private keyservers, though.
* Schleuder now fetches keys also and primarily from a VKS keyserver (the default is `keys.openpgp.org`). A tranditional HKP keyserver is only queried if the VKS server didn't have a key (and if it is configured).
* Schleuder doesn't use `dirmngr` anymore but communicates with keyservers using own code. For this it newly requires `libcurl` and the rubygem "typhoeus".
* Schleuder now knows how to import a key from an incoming email: if the email is encrypted or signed, and if the list doesn't know a key matching the sender's address (`From` header), then Schleuder will check if such a matching key is present in the email's attachments or its Autocrypt-headers. This hopefully is helpful in case a list receives emails from a lot of different people with fluctuating key usage. The feature is configurable per list, and is off by default.
* After uploading keys, the users now directly see details about the uploaded keys. This is meant to help in situations in which people accidentally upload expired keys.
* The oldest supported Ruby version is now 3.1.

We dedicate this release to RenÃ© Paulokat. He helped to kickstart this project, and his influence is still present in the code base to this day. We will keep this project alive â€“Â as long as it matters, just as RenÃ© would have done. May he rest in peace. ðŸ–¤
