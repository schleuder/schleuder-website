Due to the current situation, we won't meet in person on the upcoming Friday, 2020/03/20, but instead virtually, via Jitsi.

While this brings along quite some drawbacks, it's the best we can do right now to still stay in contact.

We have no schedule, just time to sit around, discuss ideas, ask questions, etc. Anyone is welcome, be they technically minded, politically interested or simply curious! *Friday, 2020-03-20, from 6pm (UTC) / 7pm (CET): [https://meet.immerda.ch/schleuder](https://meet.immerda.ch/schleuder)*
